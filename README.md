# Write and host a resume using Markdown, Github Pages, and Jekyll.

Purpose
--
This readme is for you to learn the software stack required to write your own resume and host it online while following Etters guidelines
for modern technical writing. To accomplish this, we will be writing your resume in markdown, generating a static website from your resume 
using Jekyll, and hosting it online using Github Pages. 

## Writing your resume

Etter stresses the importance of writing a technical document using a lightweight, human readable markup language. This is because it makes it
simple to maintain, publish, and collaborate. For these reasons we will be writing our resume in Markdown, the most popular lightweight markup
language in the world. This readme will not go into detail about how to use Markdown, but here are some resources to help you learn. 


## Generating your static website

First, we must generate a static website. 
Jekyll is a very popular and powerful static website generator which we will be using to create our site.
